1,What is the probability that 5 of next 7 cars order a Big Mac?,Bernoulli,Binomial,Hypergeometric,Geometric,Negative Binomial,B,"Because the trial number is only one,","plot(dhyper(0:5, 5, 25, 9), type = ""h"")",Binomial,"This chart has title 'PMF Graph'.
            It has x-axis 'Number of cars that order a Big Mac' with labels 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8.
            It has y-axis 'Prob. of that amount of vehicles ordering a Big Mac in 7 cars' with labels 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5.

            The chart is a bar chart with 96 vertical bars.
            There is a steady increase from 0 to 20 from probability 0 to about 0.03, then it gradually decreases and approaches probability 0 until about 100."
4,What is the probability that the next car orders a Big Mac?,Bernoulli,Binomial,Hypergeometric,Geometric,Negative Binomial,A,"Number of trials is fixed in this situation, and what of interest is number of successes.
