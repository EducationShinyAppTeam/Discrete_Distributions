1,What is the probability that a donor has type A blood?  ,Bernoulli,Binomial,Hypergeometric,Geometric,Negative Binomial,A,"Because the trial number is only one,","plot(dhyper(0:5, 5, 25, 13), type = ""h"")",Bernoulli,"This chart has title 'PMF Graph'.
            It has x-axis 'Number of donors' with labels 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.00.
            It has y-axis 'Prob. of a donor having type A blood' with labels 0.40, 0.45, 0.50, 0.55, 0.60 and 0.65.
            The chart is a set of 1 line.
            Line 1 connects 2 points, at (0, 0.6) and (1, 0.4)."
2,How many people went to this blood donation station until the first type A blood donor appears?,Bernoulli,Binomial,Hypergeometric,Geometric,Negative Binomial,D,What we want to know is the number of trials until we see the first success. ,"plot(dhyper(0:5, 5, 25, 14), type = ""h"")",Geometric,"This chart has title 'PMF Graph'.
            It has x-axis 'Number of donors' with labels 0, 5, 10 and 15.
            It has y-axis 'Prob. of the first type A blood donor going to the station' with labels 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4.
            The chart is a bar chart with 12 vertical bars.
            It starts at probability 0.4 at 0 with a steep decrease down to 0 probability until 10."
3,"One day, 10 donators went to this blood donation station. What is the probability that 6 among these 10 people have type A blood?",Bernoulli,Binomial,Hypergeometric,Geometric,Negative Binomial,B,"Number of trials is fixed in this situation, and what of interest is number of successes. ","plot(dhyper(0:5, 5, 25, 15), type = ""h"")",Binomial,"This chart has title 'PMF Graph'.
            It has x-axis 'Number of type A blood donors' with labels 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10.

            The chart is a bar chart with 11 vertical bars.
            There is a bell curve shape from 0 to 9 and the probability reaches 0.25 at the peak, which is at 4."
4,How many people went to this blood donation station until there are four type A blood donors?,Bernoulli,Binomial,Hypergeometric,Geometric,Negative Binomial,E,"In this situation, number of successes is fixed and what we want to know is the number of trials. ","plot(dhyper(0:5, 5, 25, 16), type = ""h"")",Negative Binomial,"This chart has title 'PMF Graph'.

            The chart is a bar chart with 26 vertical bars.
            There is a steady increase from 0 to 5 up to probability 0.12 (started near probability 0.02), then it begins to decrease and gradually approaches probability 0 until about 25."
5,"On the 17th of September twelve people went to this station to donate blood. Among these 12 people, 5 people have type A blood. What is the probability that 3 of the first 5 donors that day had type A blood?",Bernoulli,Binomial,Hypergeometric,Geometric,Negative Binomial,C,"In this situation, number of successes is fixed and what we want to know is the number of trials.

            The chart is a bar chart with 5 vertical bars.
            Bar 1 is centered at 0, and length is from 0 to 0.03.
            Bar 2 is centered at 1, and length is from 0 to 0.22.
