# Things Needed for This Version
1. need to change the pictures in game page (replace a man falling from the tree with a man going beyond a cliff)
2. there is a coding error in explore page -- random trials. When the number of success equals to 1 and success probability is larger than 0.3, sometimes 
it would get the error that "the sign (plus and minus) of 'by' parameter is wrong'. The error is in the ggplot, but i don't know which line of codes cause this problem.

# Ideas for Future Development
Now, it only includes five discrete distributions except for Poisson distribution. Maybe it is a good idea to add Poisson distribution into this app.
