1,We take out eight balls one at a time from the box with replacement. How many of them are red balls?,Bernoulli,Binomial,Hypergeometric,Geometric,Negative Binomial,B,"Number of trials is fixed in this situation, and what of interest is number of successes. ","plot(0:5, dbinom(0:5, size = 8, prob = 0.2), type = ""h"")",Binomial,"This chart has title 'PMF Graph'.
          It has x-axis 'Number of red balls' with labels 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8.

          The chart is a bar chart with 6 vertical bars.
          Bar 1 is centered at 0, and length is from 0 to 0.17.

2,We take balls out of the box one at a time with replacement. How many times are needed until we get three red balls?,Bernoulli,Binomial,Hypergeometric,Geometric,Negative Binomial,E,"In this situation, number of successes is fixed and what we want to know is the number of trials.

          The chart is a bar chart with 56 vertical bars.
          From 0 to 10, there is a steep increase to about 0.060 in probability (started near zero), then it gradually trails off until probability approaches 0 around 50."
3,We take balls out of the box one at a time with replacement. How many times are needed until the first red ball is taken out? ,Bernoulli,Binomial,Hypergeometric,Geometric,Negative Binomial,D,What we want to know is the number of trials until we see the first success. ,"plot(dgeom(0:30, 0.2), type = 'h')",Geometric,"This chart has title 'PMF Graph'.

4,We draw one ball out of the box. What is the probability of taking out a red ball?,Bernoulli,Binomial,Hypergeometric,Geometric,Negative Binomial,A,"Because the trial number is only one,","plot(dbern(0:30, prob = 0.2), type = ""o"")",Bernoulli,"This chart has title 'PMF Graph'.
