1,We take out eight balls one at a time from the box with replacement. How many of them are red balls?,Bernoulli,Binomial,Hypergeometric,Geometric,Negative Binomial,B,"Number of trials is fixed in this situation, and what of interest is number of successes.

2,We take balls out of the box one at a time with replacement. How many times are needed until we get three red balls?,Bernoulli,Binomial,Hypergeometric,Geometric,Negative Binomial,E,"In this situation, number of successes is fixed and what we want to know is the number of trials.

3,We take balls out of the box one at a time with replacement. How many times are needed until the first red ball is taken out? ,Bernoulli,Binomial,Hypergeometric,Geometric,Negative Binomial,D,What we want to know is the number of trials until we see the first success. ,"plot(dgeom(0:30, 0.2), type = 'h')",Geometric
4,We draw one ball out of the box. What is the probability of taking out a red ball?,Bernoulli,Binomial,Hypergeometric,Geometric,Negative Binomial,A,"Because the trial number is only one,","plot(dbern(0:30, prob = 0.2), type = ""o"")",Bernoulli
5,We take out eight balls from the box without replacement. How many of them are red balls?,Bernoulli,Binomial,Hypergeometric,Geometric,Negative Binomial,C,Number of trials is fixed and the probability of success changes (without replacement) .,"plot(dhyper(0:5, 5, 25, 8), type = ""h"")",Hypergeometric
